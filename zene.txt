Bernadett zene sz√∂veg:

You and me 
In our playhouse
Living in a veil
We never need to go without
Memories bring no joy
Or peace
We are alone.. And all we need

-Music-

Tuning out of the Poison
Every waking day
Intolerance to overcome
Fortunes won 
By the boys 
With the guns
We are alone.. Nowhere to run

-Music-

ref:
Bernadette!
You are my Liberty
I celebrate the day
That you changed My history of
Life and Death
Will alwayl leed you into
Love and regret
But you have answers
And I have the key 
For thje door to Bernadette

-Music-

Winding down our emotions
Family and friends
Becoming ghosts
To dream of 
And pass on
Time will erase
Every face, Every name
We are alone.. No one to blame

ref:
Bernadette!
You are my Liberty
I celebrate the day
That you changed My history of
Life and Death
Will alwayl leed you into
Love and regret
But you have answers
And I have the key 
For thje door to Bernadette
